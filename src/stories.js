        title: "The Last Leaf",
        text: "In a little district west of Washington Square the streets have run crazy and broken themselves into small strips called 'places.' These 'places' make strange angles and curves. One street crosses itself a time or two. An artist once discovered a valuable possibility in this street. Suppose a collector with a bill for paints, or a landlord who was collecting rent, should come along for the right address, he would never leave that labyrinth without being financially ruined. This was a story about an old artist who lived in the same building as two young female artists. One of the young women fell ill with pneumonia, and the doctor gave her little hope of recovery. She became convinced she would die when the last leaf fell from the ivy vine outside her window. The old artist, hearing this, secretly painted a leaf on the wall after the real leaves had all fallen, giving her hope and helping her recover. He, however, caught pneumonia himself while painting in the cold and died.",

        title: "The Gift of the Magi",
        text: "One dollar and eighty-seven cents. That was all. And sixty cents of it was in pennies. Pennies saved one and two at a time by bulldozing the grocer and the vegetable man and the butcher until one's cheeks burned with the silent imputation of parsimony that such close dealing implied. Three times Della counted it. One dollar and eighty-seven cents. And the next day would be Christmas. This is a story about a young couple, Della and Jim, who are very poor but deeply in love. On Christmas Eve, they each want to buy a special gift for the other. Della sells her most prized possession, her long, beautiful hair, to buy a platinum fob chain for Jim's prized gold watch. Jim, in turn, sells his watch to buy a set of ornate combs for Della's hair. They realize that their gifts, while now useless in their intended purpose, truly represent the immense love and sacrifice they made for each other, which is the greatest gift of all.",

        title: "The Tell-Tale Heart",
        text: "TRUE! --nervous --very, very dreadfully nervous I had been and am; but why will you say that I am mad? The disease had sharpened my senses --not destroyed --not dulled them. Above all was the sense of hearing acute. I heard all things in the heaven and in the earth. I heard many things in hell. How, then, am I mad? Hearken! and observe how healthily --how calmly I can tell you the whole story. This is a chilling tale narrated by an unnamed murderer who endeavors to convince the reader of his sanity while describing the meticulous murder he committed. He claims he was not mad, but merely disturbed by the pale blue, 'vulture-like' eye of an old man with whom he lived. Driven by this obsession, he carefully plans and executes the murder, dismembering the body and hiding it beneath the floorboards. However, the sound of the old man's beating heart, which he imagines he can still hear, drives him to confess his crime to the police, who were initially convinced by his calm demeanor.",

        title: "The Necklace",
        text: "She was one of those pretty and charming girls born, as if by a mistake of destiny, into a family of clerks. She had no dowry, no expectations, no means of becoming known, understood, loved, or wedded by a man of wealth and distinction; and she allowed herself to marry a petty clerk in the office of the Board of Education. The story follows Mathilde Loisel, who dreams of a life of luxury she feels she deserves, despite being born into a modest family. Her husband secures an invitation to a prestigious ball, but Mathilde is distressed by her lack of proper attire and jewelry. She borrows a magnificent diamond necklace from a wealthy friend, Madame Forestier. After the ball, she discovers the necklace is lost. Instead of confessing, she and her husband spend the next ten years working tirelessly and sacrificing everything to buy a replacement, a similar but expensive diamond necklace. In the end, Mathilde meets Madame Forestier again, only to discover that the original necklace was a cheap imitation.",

        text: "The morning of June 27th was clear and sunny, with the fresh warmth of a full-summer day; the flowers were blossoming profusely and the grass was richly green. The people of the village began to gather in the square, between the post office and the bank, around ten o'clock; and there was a great deal of fussing and chatter, and laughter that suggested a holiday spirit. This short story is set in a small American village that observes an annual ritual known as 'the lottery.' On a pleasant summer morning, the villagers gather in the town square. The lottery seems like a festive event at first, with families drawing slips of paper. However, as the process unfolds, the true, sinister nature of the lottery is revealed. The person who draws the marked slip is stoned to death by the rest of the villagers, a brutal act of ritualistic murder carried out without question or apparent remorse, highlighting themes of blind conformity, tradition, and violence.",

        title: "The Oval Portrait",
        text: "The chateau into which my wounds had forced me to intrude was one of those sprawling mixtures of gloom and grandeur common in the Apennines. It was old and decayed, but its immense size and ancient tapestries spoke of a past opulence. I found myself in a small, remote chamber, not quite the main apartment, adorned with paintings, some in the modern style, others by old masters. This eerie tale is told by a wounded narrator who takes refuge in an abandoned ch√¢teau in the Apennines. Inside, he finds a peculiar oval portrait of a young woman. As he gazes at it, he becomes fascinated by its lifelike quality and consults a small book found nearby, which details the history of the portraits. He reads about the oval portrait's subject, a vibrant young woman who married an eccentric painter obsessed with his art. The painter spent weeks obsessively capturing her likeness, neglecting her health and spirit. As he applied the final touch, he declared the portrait alive, but then looked at his wife, only to find her dead, her life having seemingly transferred into the painting.",

        title: "An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge",
        text: "A man stood upon a railroad bridge in northern Alabama, looking down into the swift water twenty feet below. The man's hands were behind his back, their wrists bound with a cord. A rope closely encircled his neck. It was a fine spring morning, and the man was about to be hanged. This Civil War story begins with Peyton Farquhar, a civilian sympathizer of the Confederacy, about to be hanged by Union soldiers on Owl Creek Bridge. As he stands on the bridge, the rope around his neck, he is distracted by a floating log. The narrative then shifts into a detailed account of his desperate escape: he falls into the water, frees himself, avoids bullets, and swims to safety. He makes his way through a dark, unfamiliar forest, tormented by strange sounds and visions, eventually reaching his home and embracing his wife. However, just as he reaches for her, he feels a sharp blow to his neck, and everything goes black. It is then revealed that his elaborate escape was merely a vivid hallucination in the moments between falling from the bridge and his actual death by hanging.",

        text: "High above the city, on a tall column, stood the statue of the Happy Prince. He was gilded all over with thin leaves of fine gold, for eyes he had two bright sapphires, and a large red ruby glowed on his sword-hilt. This poignant fairy tale tells the story of a magnificent statue, the Happy Prince, who was once a carefree prince oblivious to suffering. Now a statue overlooking his city, he sees all the poverty and misery. A little swallow, delayed on his migration to Egypt, takes refuge at the Prince's feet. The Prince persuades the swallow to pluck off his jewels and gold leaf, piece by piece, to give to the poor, the sick, and the starving children in the city. The swallow, though growing cold, loyally carries out these tasks. Eventually, the Prince is stripped of all his beauty, and the swallow, weakened by the cold and his efforts, dies at the Prince's feet. The town councillors decide to melt down the ugly, stripped statue, but the lead heart, which did not melt, and the dead swallow are thrown onto a dust heap. An angel, sent by God, chooses the lead heart and the dead swallow as the two most precious things in the city, taking them to Paradise.",

        title: "The Bet",
        text: "It was a dark autumn night. The old banker was walking up and down his study and remembering the party he had given fifteen years before. This philosophical short story begins with an old, wealthy banker recalling a party he held fifteen years prior. During the party, a discussion arose about capital punishment, with most guests arguing against it and for life imprisonment. The banker, however, argued that solitary confinement for life was more humane than immediate death. A young lawyer present argued that life in solitary confinement was worse than death. This led to a drastic bet: if the lawyer could endure fifteen years of solitary confinement, the banker would pay him two million rubles. The lawyer accepts and spends fifteen years in isolation, immersing himself in books, music, and learning. On the eve of his release, the banker, facing financial ruin, considers murdering the lawyer to avoid paying the enormous sum. However, he discovers a letter from the lawyer, who, having gained profound wisdom through his isolation, renounces the money, believing earthly possessions are meaningless. The lawyer leaves his confinement five minutes before the agreed time, forfeiting the bet.",
