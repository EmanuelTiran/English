        title: "The Last Leaf",
        text: "In a little district west of Washington Square the streets have run crazy and broken themselves into small strips called 'places.' These 'places' make strange angles and curves. One street crosses itself a time or two. An artist once discovered a valuable possibility in this street. Suppose a collector with a bill for paints, or a landlord who was collecting rent, should come along for the right address, he would never leave that labyrinth without being financially ruined. This was a story about an old artist who lived in the same building as two young female artists. One of the young women fell ill with pneumonia, and the doctor gave her little hope of recovery. She became convinced she would die when the last leaf fell from the ivy vine outside her window. The old artist, hearing this, secretly painted a leaf on the wall after the real leaves had all fallen, giving her hope and helping her recover. He, however, caught pneumonia himself while painting in the cold and died.",

        text: "TRUE! --nervous --very, very dreadfully nervous I had been and am; but why will you say that I am mad? The disease had sharpened my senses --not destroyed --not dulled them. Above all was the sense of hearing acute. I heard all things in the heaven and in the earth. I heard many things in hell. How, then, am I mad? Hearken! and observe how healthily --how calmly I can tell you the whole story. This is a chilling tale narrated by an unnamed murderer who endeavors to convince the reader of his sanity while describing the meticulous murder he committed. He claims he was not mad, but merely disturbed by the pale blue, 'vulture-like' eye of an old man with whom he lived. Driven by this obsession, he carefully plans and executes the murder, dismembering the body and hiding it beneath the floorboards. However, the sound of the old man's beating heart, which he imagines he can still hear, drives him to confess his crime to the police, who were initially convinced by his calm demeanor.",

        title: "The Oval Portrait",
        text: "The chateau into which my wounds had forced me to intrude was one of those sprawling mixtures of gloom and grandeur common in the Apennines. It was old and decayed, but its immense size and ancient tapestries spoke of a past opulence. I found myself in a small, remote chamber, not quite the main apartment, adorned with paintings, some in the modern style, others by old masters. This eerie tale is told by a wounded narrator who takes refuge in an abandoned château in the Apennines. Inside, he finds a peculiar oval portrait of a young woman. As he gazes at it, he becomes fascinated by its lifelike quality and consults a small book found nearby, which details the history of the portraits. He reads about the oval portrait's subject, a vibrant young woman who married an eccentric painter obsessed with his art. The painter spent weeks obsessively capturing her likeness, neglecting her health and spirit. As he applied the final touch, he declared the portrait alive, but then looked at his wife, only to find her dead, her life having seemingly transferred into the painting.",

A rope closely encircled his neck. It was a fine spring morning, and the man was about to be hanged. This Civil War story begins with Peyton Farquhar, a civilian sympathizer of the Confederacy, about to be hanged by Union soldiers on Owl Creek Bridge. As he stands on the bridge, the rope around his neck, he is distracted by a floating log. The narrative then shifts into a detailed account of his desperate escape: he falls into the water, frees himself, avoids bullets, and swims to safety. He makes his way through a dark, unfamiliar forest, tormented by strange sounds and visions, eventually reaching his home and embracing his wife. However, just as he reaches for her, he feels a sharp blow to his neck, and everything goes black. It is then revealed that his elaborate escape was merely a vivid hallucination in the moments between falling from the bridge and his actual death by hanging.",

He was gilded all over with thin leaves of fine gold, for eyes he had two bright sapphires, and a large red ruby glowed on his sword-hilt.

This philosophical short story begins with an old, wealthy banker recalling a party he held fifteen years prior. During the party, a discussion arose about capital punishment, with most guests arguing against it and for life imprisonment. The banker, however, argued that solitary confinement for life was more humane than immediate death. A young lawyer present argued that life in solitary confinement was worse than death. This led to a drastic bet: if the lawyer could endure fifteen years of solitary confinement, the banker would pay him two million rubles. The lawyer accepts and spends fifteen years in isolation, immersing himself in books, music, and learning. On the eve of his release, the banker, facing financial ruin, considers murdering the lawyer to avoid paying the enormous sum. However, he discovers a letter from the lawyer, who, having gained profound wisdom through his isolation, renounces the money, believing earthly possessions are meaningless. The lawyer leaves his confinement five minutes before the agreed time, forfeiting the bet.",
